# Omniverse Kit App Template

This project contains everything necessary to develop and package an Omniverse App.


## What Is an App?

Ultimately, an Omniverse Kit app is a `.kit` file. It is a single file extension. You can think of it as a tip of dependencies pyramid, a final extension that pulls everything.

Extensive documentation detailing what extensions are and how they work can be found [here](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/py/kit/docs/guide/extensions.html).
